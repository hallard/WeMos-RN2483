# Startup config file for Microchip RN2483 join TTN in otaa
# commands prefixed by ! or $ are executed by ESP all others passed to serial module
# command starting with $ wait until device return \n 
# RN2483 always return string followed by "\r\n" on each command (ex "ok\r\n")
# so $ wait a response (good or not) before sending next command
# !delay or any $ are not executed when connected via browser web terminal (websocket)
# See schematics here https://github.com/hallard/WeMos-RN2483

# Your device should have been registered on TTN before using, here is how to
# On the RN2483, use `sys get hweui` and `mac get deveui` you get the devices hweui & deveui
# They are probably the same, then register device on TTN dashboard
# or with command line with `ttnctl devices register YOUR-DEV-EUI`
# see help https://github.com/lukastheiler/ttn_moteino/blob/master/Readme.md

# Then you must setup your keys (obtained from TTN dashboard)
# or in command line with `ttnctl devices info YOUR-DEV-EUI`
# then on RN2483 device (1st setup)
# $mac set appeui YOUR_APP_EUI
# $mac set appkey YOUR_APP_KEY
# and saved with `mac save`
# $mac save

# Then Join TTN Network
